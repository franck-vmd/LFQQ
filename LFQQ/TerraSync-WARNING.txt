This folder is managed by FlightGear's download system.
Any changes you make here or in sub-folders will be overwritten when TerraSync
downloads updates.

To use custom scenery or data with FlightGear, put it in a different location
on your computer, then add the location using either the launcher 'Add-ons' page, or by
passing '--fg-scenery=<location>' on the command line.
